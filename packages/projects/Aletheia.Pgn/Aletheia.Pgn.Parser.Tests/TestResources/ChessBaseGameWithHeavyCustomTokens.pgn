Mont, 500 Master Games of Chess, pp. 5-6. All comments are Tartakower's unless
otherwise noted. The following game is a good example of how rooks should be
handled. It shows that their work can be far more flexible than is generally
supposed.} 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. c3 d6 ({Combining development
with a threat by} 4... Nf6 {is a more active procedure.}) 5. d4 exd4 6. cxd4
Bb6 ({After} 6... Bb4+ {White would have the choice between} 7. Nc3 {(or even
7.Kf1 threatening 8.d5 Ne5 followed by 9.Qa4+) Now, however, Black's Bishop at
b6 continues to control the hostile centre.}) 7. d5 {Closing the centre and
particularly the diagonal occupied by his Bishop at c4. But he hopes, in
return, to obtain free play for his remaining pieces. The most intensive
continuation is 7. Nc3. 7....} Ne5 ({A mistake would be} 7... Na5 {because of
8.Bd3 with the threat 9.b4. 7.... Nce7}) ({And if} 7... Nce7 8. e5 {favours
White's chances.}) 8. Nxe5 dxe5 9. Nc3 (9. O-O $145 Nf6 10. Nc3 O-O 11. h3 Ne8

simplification;} ({more effective— with the same kind of idea—was} 11... h6

is a fine conception, which combines defence (prevention of the liberating
move 14....f5) with attack (breakthrough on the f-file. It is clear that Black

counter-action (18 .... h5), but 14 .... Kh8 would have been more level-headed.
Other lines of defence would be 14 .... h6 or 14 .... Ba5, in order to
eliminate a dangerous unit; but Black does not seem to fear his adversary's
machinations.} 15. Ne2 Rh8 16. Rg1 Kf8 17. Rg2 {With the double mission of
rendering the king mobile (by guarding the pawn on f2) and of doubling rooks

A sounder continuation would be 18....Bd7 to be followed by ....Rag8.} 19. g5

resources and to assess his own chances too highly. There was a complicated
